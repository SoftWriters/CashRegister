Cash Register
============

possible limitations on input when greater over 999.00. I added 5, 10,20,50,100 bills, wasn't sure if it was necessary.

if input is 1,000.00,1,200.00 there will be issues when separated by comma.

making sure the 1st input is less than the 2nd input.
I added an error check just in case if a scenario happened.

Drag a text file with the sample input to the executable will run the program or modify the launchsettings.json

In the UnitTests Project Resources folder is the textfile I used to sample my input.

I had fun with this coding test.

Thank you,
Michael
