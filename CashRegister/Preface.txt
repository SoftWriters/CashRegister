I have created this project with the idea that the console is the consumer of a CashRegister system that allows for the injection
of both the Currency type (USD, YEN, etc...) along with the strategy for change calculation. Future development would be able to allow
for different strategies to be injected using IOC containers in a configuration to quickly change the functionality and currency of the
CashRegister system.

I have put more comments in this code than I normally do in production code as too many comments can be a code smell.  I understand that
comments are important, but are best used sparingly. It is more important to use correct naming conventions and clear code that can be read
easily, then to trash code with a bunch of comments that with time may not be updated to reflect the actual working of the software. Code itself
should be the documentation.

If there are any questions or comments please email me at plwest.axiom@gmail.com and I will respond at the earliest possible time. I can also provide
you with photos of my paperwork that includes my initial design notes, revision notes, and just my thoughts as I was working through this project.

I appreciate your evaluation and giving me this oppritunity.  Thank you.
