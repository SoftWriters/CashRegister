 ============
+
+The Problem
+-----------
+Creative Cash Draw Solutions is a client who wants to provide something different for the cashiers who use their system. The function of the application is to tell the cashier how much change is owed, and what denominations should be used. In most cases the app should return the minimum amount of physical change, but the client would like to add a twist. If the "owed" amount is divisible by 3, the app should randomly generate the change denominations (but the math still needs to be right :))
+
+Please write a program which accomplishes the clients goals. The program should:
+
+1. Accept a flat file as input
+	1. Each line will contain the amount owed and the amount paid separated by a comma (for example: 2.13,3.00)
+	2. Expect that there will be multiple lines
+2. Output the change the cashier should return to the customer
+	1. The return string should look like: 1 dollar,2 quarters,1 nickel, etc ...
+	2. Each new line in the input file should be a new line in the output file
+
+Sample Input
+------------
+2.12,3.00
+
+1.97,2.00
+
+3.33,5.00
+
+Sample Output
+-------------
+3 quarters,1 dime,3 pennies
+
+3 pennies
+
+1 dollar,1 quarter,6 nickels,12 pennies
+
+*Remember the last one is random
+
+The Fine Print
